# Roman Numerals Kata

Converting arabic numerals into roman numerals in Ruby and using TDD.

For now the focus is on 1,2,3 and 5,6,7,8

**Update**: 04/10/16 Now going up to number 20 and trying to get IV, IX, X, XIV, XIX, XX to pass

**Update**: 05/10/16 Refactored code to iterate over a numbers array 

**Update**: 06/10/16 Added additional tests for numbers 4, 14, 19 and 20 and they all pass which means the code is working
